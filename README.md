# Reverse an Array
Reverse an array given as input. 

## Challenge
Get an array of values, reverse the array and display the same to user.

## Approach and Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Approach is to swap the values between first and last indexes and keep moving inwards until the mid point i reached. This method needs iterations of half the length of array.
Have done this with 2 methods 1) loop and 2) recursion
